# E-Commerce-Product-Insights
Project on analyzing e-commerce product data to extract insights using Python

## Objective
Analyze e-commerce product data to extract insights on brand, category, price, availability, and other attributes.

## Dataset
`products.csv` - Contains product details such as brand, category, price, stock, color, size, etc.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Statistical Analysis  
4. Data Visualization  
5. Insights & Recommendations  
6. **Interactive Dashboard using Plotly** (for dynamic exploration of availability, price, brand, and category)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/piyushmishra76/E-Commerce-Product-Insights
2. Navigate to the folder:E-Commerce-Product-Insights
3. Install required libraries:Requirement.txt
4. Open the notebook and run all cells

5. The **interactive dashboard** is at the end of the notebook; you can explore plots dynamically in Plotly.

## Key Insights
- Brand distribution is fairly even.  
- Categories like Clothing & Kitchen Appliances have high product counts.  
- Price distribution varies across categories.  
- Stock availability doesnâ€™t strongly correlate with price.  
- Most common product colors and sizes identified.  
- **Interactive dashboard allows exploring trends dynamically.**

## Conclusion
Complete process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a product dataset to help business decisions, inventory management, and product strategy.
